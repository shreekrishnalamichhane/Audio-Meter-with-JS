## Audio-Meter using JS
This is the simple Audio Visualizer using JS.
It will take the audio from the microphone and display the audio level in a canvas at realtime.

### Error Message from Crome Console.

So, Here I use a button to solve that problem. So the function will load only you click on that button.

### I believe on opensource.
So any pull requests with the bug fixing and new feature will be appreciated.
Thanks.
