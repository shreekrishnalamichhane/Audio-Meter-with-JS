## Audio-Meter using JS
This is the simple Audio Visualizer using JS.
It will take the audio from the microphone and display the audio level in a canvas at realtime. 

ðŸ”´ðŸ”´Note: Since Modern Browsers like Crome,Firebox, etc  blocks the microphone access on page load by
default due to security concerns, you cannot start the window.AudioContext on the page load.

Here I use a button to solve that problem. So the function will load only you click on that button.

### I believe on opensource.
So any pull requests with the bug fixing and new feature will be appreciated.
